# Overview
The eledmac package is for typesetting critical editions. It is a LaTeX port, and extension, of the plain TeX EDMAC, TABMAC and EDSTANZA macros. The eledpar package is an extension of eledmac enabling parallel typesetting in columns or on facing pages.

Eledmac and eledpar are successors of ledmac and ledpar.

The package is available on [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eledmac).
