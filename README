# Overview
The eledmac package is for typesetting critical editions. It is a LaTeX port, and extension, of the plain TeX EDMAC, TABMAC and EDSTANZA macros. The eledpar package is an extension of eledmac enabling parallel typesetting in columns or on facing pages.

Eledmac and eledpar are successors of ledmac and ledpar.

The package is available on [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eledmac).

Maïeul Rouquette is the only one maintener. To help him in his work, please follow these rules:

- Go to the [issues page](https://github.com/maieul/ledmac/issues);
- Open *one issue by problem*, even if problems are similar.
- Add a [minimal working example](http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=minxampl).
- If your report is really a bug, Maïeul Rouquette will open a "branch" to solve your problem. This branch will be called "issueXXX", where "XXX" is the issue number.
- When the problem will be solved, Maïeul Rouquette will ask you to try the solution:
	- Dowload the zip of the branch (or, go to branch with Git, if you know it):
		- Go to [the project page](https://github.com/maieul/ledmac/).
		- Choose the correct branch is the "branch" menu.
		- Click to the cloud, in the right side.
	- Run the `.ins` files with pdflatex, to obtain the `.sty` files.
	- Put the `.sty` files along your test files.
	- Make you report.
