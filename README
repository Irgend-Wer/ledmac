    The eledmac package is for typesetting critical editions. It is a
LaTeX port, and extension, of the plain TeX EDMAC, TABMAC and EDSTANZA
macros. The eledpar package is an extension of eledmac enabling parallel
typesetting in columns or on facing pages. 

Eledmac and eledpar are successors of ledmac and ledpar.

    Bug reports and suggestions are welcome.

    To install the eledmac package:
o run: latex eledmac.ins (which will generate ledmac.sty)
o Move ledmac.sty (and ledpatch.sty if it exists) to a location where 
  LaTeX will find it (for more information on this see the FAQ).

    To generate a second copy of the manual (which is already supplied as a PDF file):
o run: make eledmac.pdf

    Installation of the other packages (via eledpar.ins)
is similar.
