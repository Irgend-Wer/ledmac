The town seems so full of \edt{peo\-ple,}{\A{people L4}} with such busy 
faces, all in motion, that I can hardly fancy that it is not some 
celebrated \edt{fair,}{\A{fair; F}} but I see \edt{'tis}{\A{it is F; 'tis

more \edt{advantageously}{\A{advantageous \^\textsuperscript{ly} \sout{ly}

are seven large \edt{canals,}{\A{Canals, HP; canals, F; Canals L4}} on 
which the \edt{merchant}{\A{merchants F}} \edt{ships,}{\A{ships F L4}} come 
up to the very doors of their \edt{houses}{\A{\sout{Merchants}

The shops and warehouses are of a \edt{surprising}{\A{surprising 1758; 
surprizing HF}} neatness and magnificence, filled with an incredible 
quantity of fine \edt{merchandise}{\A{Merchandise 1701; Merchandize HP;

\edt{England,}{\A{England, that F}} I have much ado to persuade myself I am 
still so near it.

England just as the Seventh Ottoman-Venetian War with Austria (1714--1718) 
began favoring Austria. On 25 Jul. [5 Aug.], the Austrian imperial army, 
led by Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663--1736), claimed victory at the Battle 
of Petrovaradin (Petrovaradin is a city now in Serbia). The win gave 
strategic advantages to the Holy Roman Empire (European territories led by 
emperor Charles VI (1684--1740) also archduke of Austria) over Britian's 
neutrality and France's ambitions to dominate Europe. Petrovaradin also 
empowered George I, the target of the 1715 Jacobite rebellion led by Lady 
Mar's husband, the earl. Robethon to Polwarth: ``There is no appearance of 
France openly assisting the Pretender, and after this victory of Prince 
Eugene's over the Turks, which will be followed promptly by peace, France 
will seek our friendship more than ever. All quiet in England" (Aug. [10] 
21; \I{Polwarth}, 1:60). George I ruled both Great Britain (neutral in 
this war) and the German electorate of Hanover (allied to the Holy Roman 
empire). In 1683, he had been volunteered (as surety for Hanoverian 
forces) to fight with Austria against the Turks during the second siege of 
Vienna in 1683 (Hatton, 43). George I followed this war closely. For the 
Seventh Ottoman-Venetian War, see Letter 7, l.6n; for electorates, Letter 
15, l.12n.; for the first (1529) and second sieges of Vienna, Letter 7, 
n.19; for Hanover and George I, Letters 17--19.}}. It}{\A{project, it
