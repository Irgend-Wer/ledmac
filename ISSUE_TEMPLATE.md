Issue can be opened in English or in French (I prefer in French). Please fill this form.
Please open one issue by problem, and not a global issue for multiple problems. 

# Version of reledmac / reledpar (if that is a devellopement version, please precise the branch)

# If this is a newly introduced problem, please indicate the last working version of the package(s)
# Does the problem happen only when combining with some packages?

# Does the problem happens both in parallel typesetting and normal typesetting?

# Description of the problem

# Minimal Working Example

Please provide a [MWE](http://minimalbeispiel.de/mini-en.html). 
In  case where the problem happens both in parallel typesetting and normal typesetting, please make your MWE in normal typesetting (because your MWE must be _Minimal_).
