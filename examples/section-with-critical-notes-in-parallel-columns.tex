\title{Sectioning commands with critical notes in parallel}



{\let\newpage\relax\maketitle}
{\small
This file provides example of using sectioning command with elepar. The section title are  in the line numbering, and have critical notes. 

The left and right sides are put in column. We use \verb+\eledsectnotoc{L}+ to say we want the right titles be added to the table of contents, and not the left titles.  

We use the \verb+\eledxxx+ commands, each of them in their own \verb+\pstartâ€¦\pend+ group. 

Page clearings are manually added before chapter with \verb+\beforeeledchapter+.
