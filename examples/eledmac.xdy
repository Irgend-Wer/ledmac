;;;; Mandatory lines for eledmac
;; The following lines are mandatory
;; to allow eledmac understand the reference 
;; in the form of :
;; pagenumber-linenumber
;; which are provide by \edtext
(define-location-class "eledmac"
	("arabic-numbers" :sep"-" "arabic-numbers")
	:hierdepth 2
)


;;;; Example of eledmac index customization

;; The following lines allow to print
;; in the the line number between parenthesis
;; after the page number and with comma between lines number.
;; Such setting is strangly recommended, in order to make distinction
;; between location reference ranges, marked by a dash and 
;; difference between page number and line number, 
;; which is by default also marked by a dash.
;;
;; So uncomment these lines to use them.  

;(markup-locref-list  :open " (" :sep ", " :close ")"
;                       :depth 1  :class "eledmac")
                      


;;;; The following lines should be uncommented if you use xindy + hyperref package

;; The first group is not directly linked to eledmac, 
;; but is required to have internal hyperlink in the index 
;; if you use the hyperindex=false option of hyperref.
;; In general this option and these lines are recommended
;; to provide best compatibility between hyperref and xindy.
;; Read http://geekographie.maieul.net/172 for further explanations.
