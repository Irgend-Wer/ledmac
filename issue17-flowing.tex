    One morning, when Gregor Samsa\footnoteA{Obscure reference 1} woke from
    troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
    horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his
    head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by
    arches into stiff sections. The bedding(B) was hardly able to
    cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs,
    pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about
    helplessly as he looked. \enquote{What's happened to me?} he thought. It
    wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room\footnoteB{One day however a
      small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for
      the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so,
      because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and
    devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen.} although a
    little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A
    collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table -
    Samsa\footnoteA{Obscure reference 2} was a travelling salesman - and
    above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an
    illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a
    lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a
    heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the
    viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.

    A wonderful serenity\footnoteB{Far far away, behind the word mountains, far
      from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind
      texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the
    Semantics, a large language ocean.} has taken possession of my entire
    soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole
    heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was
    created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear
    friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence,
    that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single
    stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater
    artist than now. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the
